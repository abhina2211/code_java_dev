#This is the solution description file for Problem A.2

Since the code should be able to handle different type of birds I have restructured the code to make use of Factory Patterns.

By using this pattern we can not only make the code maintainable but also scalable.I  have also used the accessor and mutator to retrieve and update animalName.
BirdFactory class can later be modified to include the behavior of parrot.
